     * Note on installation names. In most cases it will be desirable to give custom distributions a meaningful name and use that name as part of test name. Most likely this will be useful not only for
     * integration tests but in other scenarios too (Hudson and m2e immediately come to mind), so the name/version need to be embedded in the maven installation itself. For example, it can be a file
     * under ${maven.home}/conf directory, similar to /etc/issue used by linux distributions. It is also possible to include distribution name/version in one of the jars, similar to how maven version is
     * already included in META-INF/maven/org.apache.maven/maven-core/pom.properties.
